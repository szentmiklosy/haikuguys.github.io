      "A Total Mess": "There was ________________________ everywhere.  It was a nightmare.  I don’t know why ____________ even thought it was a good idea to bring _____________ in the first place.  I mean, my first thought was ___________________________ but after a few minutes, I noticed the ____________ wasn’t going to _________ the way we thought it would.  And that’s why you don’t bring _________ to a ___________________.",
      "Never On Time": "Yeah, well if __________ had showed up on time for us to leave for the ____________ we wouldn’t have had to __________________ so many times on the way there.  I mean, it’s fine.  At least we got to talk about ______________ for a few hours while sitting in traffic.  All this time I had no idea that _________________ was so into _______________. By the time we got there I couldn’t stop thinking about all the times (s)he was probably _______________ while I  was sleeping.",
      "My Friend is Ridiculous": "OMG, did you hear about how _______________ went to the ____________ and ______ with the ____________ for like an entire hour?  WTF is up with that?  Do you remember the last time s/he ________________________ with all those _____________?  This reminds me of that and I’ve been waiting to tell you for a week. If I didn't encounter a ____________ immediately after I found out, I would have come over that night with some __________ so we could gossip and _________________ before tweeting about it.",
      "So Annoying": "With __________ , it’s always sort of a _____________ and I just can’t get over it. The past few days have been kind of ___________________ but the _________ is making it a little better.",
      "Lost in Translation": "So the other day I sent a text to _____________ and instead of rainbows and sunshine, he/she responded all ____________ . It was kind of weird. Instead of letting it get to me, I put my shoes on and ____________________ . It helped for a little until I ran into a ________________ holding a _______________ and wielding it with fury.",
      "The Adventure": "It was perfect. All my life ___________ and I talked about going to _____________ . After weeks of planning, we packed a _____________ , a ________________ , and a ______________ then hit the road. The mountains were lined with colorful ____________ and seemingly limitless ___________ . At one of the rest stops, there was a ___________ selling ____________ , which actually came in pretty handy over the next few days every time we needed to _______________ the _______________ .",
      "Best of Times": "My favorite moment with ___________ was when we _________________________ together. Every time I remember the way (s)he __________________ with the _______________ , it makes me feel ____________ inside. Since then, our dynamic has become ____________ and when our friends talk about us they say things like \”oh! __________ and __________ , they are like when _________________ and _____________ combine.",
      "Ugh, That Balloon": "There’s an old balloon stuck in a tree outside our window. I’m pretty sure it says _____________ . It must be from that time when a group of _______________ came stampeding down the street shouting __________________ at like 7AM for no good reason. You should have seen the way _____________ reacted by throwing all of our _______________ out the window at them.",
      "Can't Even": "_________________ can sometimes be a little ______________ . It’s not really that big of a deal though, because the way he/she ___________’s totally makes up for it. We were together a few _________ ago and forgot to ___________ the _____________ . We had to explain ourselves to ______________ and it became a ___________ . That was the last time we ever ______________ and I’m kind of okay with it.",
      "Had a Good Time": "Okay, so this one time, __________ and I went to the ______________ . It was literally the best time ever. The first thing we did when we got there was ______________ . It was SO ___________ that we decided to _____________ for the rest of the time and not even look around more. The rest of the night was ____________ because I couldn’t handle all the ______________ . We only talk about it every now and then."
      "Friendly Competition": "It’s okay when ______________ does ________________ but I can do it better. Everyone agrees. For example, we were at the _________________ talking to ______________ and a __________ walked in. When this happened, ______________  didn’t even ____________ . Shouldn't it be obvious?",
      "Quit It": "How many times do I have to tell you, ________________ , to please never _____________ again? I’ve written you several letters over the past few _______________ explaining that when you ____________ in regularity, ______________ happens. Diid you not receive them? Or did you ______________ them instead with that ____________ I got you for your birthday last year?"
